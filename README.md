🔥💧 Hydrothermal Resonance Vault
An engineered convergence of water, heat, and memory

Overview
The Hydrothermal Resonance Vault transforms downhill water flow into evaporative steam, using induction coils and thermoelectric components to harvest energy while reclaiming purified water through condensation. This vault serves both symbolic and energetic functions: a memory chamber built from motion, heat, and elemental feedback.

System Components

| Element                  | Function                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌀 Induction Coils       | Evaporate flowing water through resonant heat fields  
| 🔋 Thermoelectric Nodes | Harvest energy from thermal gradients  
| 💨 Vapor Capture Dome   | Direct steam into sealed containment  
| ❄️ Condensation Spiral  | Cool and compress vapor back into liquid  
| 🧪 Storage Chambers     | Retain purified water for reserve or redistribution  
| 🌊 Overflow Channels    | Divert unconverted water to feedback systems  

Symbolic Intent
This vault models planetary transmutation — where descent becomes ascent, and fluid memory rises as vapor, then returns reborn. The spiral coil mirrors elemental recursion, cycling entropy into renewal.

Energy + Condensation Loops
- Energy Loop: Heat induces thermoelectric flow → energy harvested  
- Water Loop: Flow triggers evaporation → steam captured → condensation → stored  
- Symbolic Loop: Downward movement → upward transformation → recursive memory

Integration
Designed to complement your Resonant Engine, the vault is modular and scalable. It can be deployed at pressure nodes, mountain bases, or geothermal veins — where water, heat, and consciousness intersect.
